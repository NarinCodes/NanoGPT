# NanoGPT
Generative AI project that leverages Transformer-architecture to build and train a Language Model. The model is trained on all the combined works of William Shakespeare. Running the main Python script will kick-off a generative process that produces infinite Shakespeare — in other words, it infinitely produces text that resembles his scripts.

Run the following command in the terminal to kick-off the generative process: `python3 run.py`. This will first involve model training (which may take a long time on CPU — but generally runs fast on GPU) and then end with to the model's text generation process.

Also, note that the `output.txt` file contains a sample of generated text in case one wishes to view the output without training the model.
