# NanoGPT
Generative AI project that leverages Transformer-architecture to build and train a Language Model. The model is trained on all the combined works of William Shakespeare. Running the main Python script will kick-off a generative process that produces infinite Shakespeare â€” in other words, it infinitely produces text that resembles his scripts.
